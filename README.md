# Texas-Holdem-Poker-Reinforcement-Learning

## Overview:
This project is a Python-based implementation designed to teach a deep neural network model how to play Texas Hold'em Poker in the 2-player version. It leverages reinforcement learning techniques along with TensorFlow and Keras to train an AI opponent capable of playing the popular card game. The primary objective is to create an AI that can make intelligent decisions, adapt to various game scenarios, and ultimately compete effectively against human players in a two-player Texas Hold'em Poker match.

## Project Description - How It Works:

## Usage:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jarczano/Sudoku-Solver-Web-App`
- Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `train RL.py`: `python train RL.py`
- or
- Run `train RL multiprocess.py`: `python train RL multiprocess.py`

The trained model will be saved as an .h5 file in the /models folder
